We investigate three factors: (i) how many \ac{meld} feature \emph{stages} are fed into the GNN block; (ii) how many hidden layers from the text encoder are injected into the GuideDecoder; and (iii) the effect of including textual descriptions. 

We freeze the \ac{meld} backbone. In all variants, we \emph{train} the same geometry-based upsampling path
(HexUnpool + SpiralConv) and the segmentation head. The variants differ only in whether and how
the GuideDecoder is used before upsampling:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Unpool+Spiral (no text).} No GuideDecoder is used; features are fed directly into the
        upsampling path (HexUnpool + SpiralConv) and the segmentation head; no textual input.
  \item \textbf{GuideDecoder (self-attention only).} A GuideDecoder layer is inserted before upsampling,
        but the text branch is disabled, so only self-attention operates; the same Unpool+Spiral path and
        segmentation head are trained.
  \item \textbf{GuideDecoder + Text (full).} The full GuideDecoder is used (self-attention plus
        cross-attention to the text encoder); textual descriptions are provided, while the same
        Unpool+Spiral path and segmentation head are trained.
\end{enumerate}
